# Watch Commander üëÆ
Clean up your Sonarr and Radarr archive by checking what is available on your streaming services (like Netflix, Disney+
and Amazon Prime Video), using the JustWatch website.‚ÄçÔ∏è

## Configuration
See `watchcommander.example.yml` for an example configuration file.
Rename it to `watchcommander.yml` and place it in the working directory of the application, or pass the path as the
first argument when running the application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
I created this script to help with my use case. It might not work as you expect as there are some assumptions in the
code that are based on my preferences. *Be warned, use at your own risk!*

Also note that I am in no way affiliated with any of the streaming providers, nor JustWatch.
I only created this because I thought it would be a nice idea.
